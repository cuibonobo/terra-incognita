      <p><a href="https://cuibonobo.com" target='blank'>cuibonobo</a> (n√©e Jen Garcia) is a Puerto Rican artist, engineer, and organizer. Her work sets out to amplify voices and connect disparate disciplines so that people can feel empowered and connected. As a result, she rarely works alone. Her skills in computer graphics, electronics, augmented reality, and other engineering fields have added life and reach to many artistic projects: gallery installations with rhythmic glow, murals that can dance, sculptures powered by the sun. cuibonobo&rsquo;s favorite moment is when someone asks, &ldquo;Is this possible?&rdquo; and she can say, &ldquo;Yes, and let me show you how.&rdquo;</p>
