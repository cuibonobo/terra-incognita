      <h2>Terra Incognita 2.0</h2>
      <p>Terra Incognita 2.0 is a collaboration between <a href="https://ronlsaunders.com/" target='blank'>Ron Saunders</a> and <a href="https://cuibonobo.com" target='blank'>cuibonobo</a>. The work is a visual corpus composed of Instagram images tagged with <code>#landscape</code> that uses an algorithm to continually generate a new composition. Viewers are invited to collaboratively intervene through manipulating parameters using their cell phone in order to generate/build/create their own generalized landscape.</p>
      <p>The work&rsquo;s origin began in 2002 when Saunders drove for four days to relocate to Los Angeles. The initial excitement of the road trip faded away as the hum and consistency of the Interstate highway set in and time seemed to lose its meaning. Using the front windshield as his viewfinder, Ron took photos with a disposable camera throughout the day as the landscape sped by. Later, these photographs were manually cut into small sections and repositioned into a larger composition so that a single day of travel could be experienced as stereographic landscape, a synchronous compression of speed and time.</p>
      <p>Our current understanding of landscapes, movement, and experiences have been further expanded by cell phone apps like Instagram and Tiktok, where we can achieve infinite scrolling. Just like viewing scenery through a speeding car window, scrolling through landscapes and images of nature can deliver us into a meditative, repetitive lull. Similarly, like interconnected roads, hashtags and comments link images together informing us how we should navigate and interact with a given landscape.</p>
      <p>Over time and as a result of technology, our contemporary understanding of landscape in the museum has moved beyond the appreciation of a static, singular representation of beautiful scenery. The landscape before you is malleable and untethered from time or location. Itâ€™s assembled through both human and technological mediation ultimately representing all landscapes simultaneously.</p>
